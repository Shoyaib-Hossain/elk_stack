ELK Stack

This Docker Compose file defines the complete ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack that works with the Filebeat and Logstash configurations you shared earlier. Let me explain how it all fits together:

The Complete Log Pipeline
This Docker Compose configuration creates a full logging infrastructure where:
1.	Filebeat (from my first configuration) collects logs from:
o	Docker containers (/var/lib/docker/containers)
o	System logs (/var/log)
2.	Logstash (from my second configuration) receives those logs via port 5044, processes them, and forwards them to Elasticsearch
3.	Elasticsearch stores all the processed logs for searching and analysis
4.	Kibana provides a web interface to visualize and search through the logs
Integration Points

•	The Docker Compose file mounts my Filebeat and Logstash configuration files into their respective containers:

o	./filebeat/filebeat.yml:/usr/share/filebeat/filebeat.yml:ro
o	./logstash/pipeline:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline:to

•	The configurations all reference each other correctly:
o	Filebeat is configured to send to logstash:5044
o	Logstash listens on port 5044 and forwards to elasticsearch:9200
o	Kibana connects to Elasticsearch for visualization

Security Configuration

The compose file also includes a setup service that:
•	Creates necessary users and roles in Elasticsearch
•	Sets passwords for system users
•	Creates a special logstash_internal user with the correct permissions to write to the Elasticsearch indices
This matches exactly with my Logstash configuration which uses:
user => "logstash_internal"
password => "@@@@@@@"
This Docker Compose file is essentially the deployment mechanism for the complete logging pipeline that includes my Filebeat and Logstash configurations, along with the Elasticsearch storage and Kibana visualization layers.

Filebeat and Logstash Configurations

These two configurations work together to form a complete log collection and processing pipeline:

 Data Flow

1. Filebeat (First Configuration)
   - Acts as the log collector on my servers/containers
   - Collects logs from Docker containers and system log files
   - Ships these logs to Logstash on port 5044

2. Logstash (Second Configuration)
   - Receives logs from Filebeat on port 5044 (matching Filebeat's output configuration)
   - Processes and transforms the logs (parsing timestamps, adding metadata)
   - Forwards the processed logs to Elasticsearch

 Key Connection Points

- Filebeat → Logstash: 
  - Filebeat's `output.logstash.hosts: ["logstash:5044"]` sends data to
  - Logstash's `input { beats { port => 5044 } }` which receives it

- Processing Chain:
  - Filebeat adds Docker metadata with `add_docker_metadata`
  - Logstash further processes this with grok parsing and timestamp extraction
  - Logstash adds additional fields like `[event][dataset]` and `[processed_by]`

 Purpose

This is a standard ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack setup for centralized logging where:
- Filebeat handles efficient, lightweight log collection
- Logstash provides powerful processing and transformation
- Elasticsearch (referenced in the Logstash output) stores the logs for searching and analysis

The configurations show a system designed to collect both application logs (from Docker containers) and system logs, process them with a common format, and store them with proper timestamps for later analysis.
