Complete ELK Stack Logging Infrastructure

The Docker Compose file I shared works together with Ir Filebeat and Logstash configurations to create a comprehensive log collection, processing, and visualization system. Here's how all the pieces fit together:
Data Flow Architecture
1.	Data Collection (Filebeat)
o	Deploys with access to host logs (/var/log:/var/log:ro)
o	Collects Docker container logs (/var/lib/docker/containers:/var/lib/docker/containers:ro)
o	Uses the configuration I shared first to define what logs to collect
o	Ships logs to Logstash at port 5044

3.	Processing Layer (Logstash)
o	Receives logs from Filebeat on port 5044
o	Processes logs using the pipeline configuration I shared second
o	Parses timestamps, adds metadata, and structures logs
o	Authenticates to Elasticsearch using the logstash_internal user

4.	Storage Layer (Elasticsearch)
o	Stores processed logs in daily indices (logstash-YYYY.MM.DD)
o	Provides search functionality
o	Manages security with dedicated users and roles

5.	Visualization Layer (Kibana)
o	Connects to Elasticsearch as the kibana_system user
o	Provides dashboards and visualizations for the logs

Deployment Architecture

The Docker Compose file creates a complete environment where:
•	A dedicated network (elastic) connects all services
•	Persistent storage preserves Elasticsearch data (elasticsearch-data volume)
•	Security is configured during initial setup
•	All services have appropriate resource limits and configurations

This setup allows to deploy the entire logging stack with a single command, creating a cohesive system that implements the configurations for Filebeat and Logstash.
